# CSE 168 final project: GemTracer
## Author Name: Pui Tim Cheng

In this final project, I am planning to render a picture of different type of gem stones, which will include the topics of specular transmission, attenuation, andlight dispersion.

Here are some paper that are related to the topics:
1. Production Volume Rendering SIGGRAPH 2017 Course: https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProductionVolumeRendering/paper.pdf
2. Microfacet Models for Refraction through Rough Surfaces: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/publications/EGSR07-btdf.pdf
3. Graphics gems revisited: fast and physically-based rendering of gemstones: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015706.1015708


I downloaded a free obj file from cgtrader by author alexmit:
